# Chess Board Game
### This is a very simple chess game that I made using `HTML`, `CSS` and `JAVASCRIPT`. It is a two player game that allows you to play chess with a friend. It is not a very advanced game, but it is a good way to pass the time. I hope you enjoy it!

## I am working on a full-functional multi-player chess game (_server and client_) in React and Node. In this project I basically focused on developing a javascript chess engine that I could use in it.
